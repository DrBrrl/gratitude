# Gratitude

Gratitude is a planned responsive single-page application (SPA) for daily gratitude reflection. Each day, an AI generates a prompt the user can respond to. Over time, it should learn which prompts suit that person and adapt to their preferences and feedback.

The aim is to make reflection approachable, personal, and useful—whether someone has a few words to share or wants to write at length.

## Status

The repository contains a Svelte 5 / SvelteKit application with a responsive dark landing page, a Nix development shell, Playwright functional and screenshot tests, and GitHub Pages deployment. Journaling, AI integration, and persistent storage are not implemented yet.

## Intended experience

- Open the app on a phone, tablet, or desktop and receive a daily gratitude prompt.
- Write a response, with the freedom to skip a prompt or ask for another.
- Give feedback about what feels helpful, repetitive, or inappropriate.
- Receive prompts that become more relevant over time, with control over personalization.
- Revisit past reflections in a private journal.

These are product intentions, not currently available features. See [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the project’s intended end state.

## Development

Use the locked Nix shell for Node 24, Chromium, and repository tooling:

```sh
nix develop
npm ci
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. To validate a production build:

```sh
npm run check
npm run test:deployment
npm run test:e2e
```

See [E2E_GUIDE.md](E2E_GUIDE.md) for scenarios, reports, and testing on Nix or other systems. [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) explains automatic production deployments and per-PR previews on GitHub Pages. Production is served at [drbrrl.github.io/gratitude](https://drbrrl.github.io/gratitude/) after the scaffold is merged and its workflow succeeds.

The storage, authentication, and AI integration architecture remains to be selected. See the design for the intended experience beyond this initial scaffold.
